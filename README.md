# Responsive Travel Website

### Responsive Travel Website

This is a personal project, as a way to learn more basics and fundamentals of html, css and javascript, see this basic stack, applied to the practice of developing a page, the project was guided, in some things, such as the following:

- Responsive Travel Website Design Using HTML CSS & JavaScript
- Contains animations when scrolling.
- Smooth scrolling in each section.
- Developed first with the Mobile First methodology, then for desktop.
- Compatible with all mobile devices and with a beautiful and pleasant user interface.

Others were personally added, with previous knowledge. And even though it was guided, there were things that I had to do differently, or investigate, because they gave me errors, or did not fit the guide.
